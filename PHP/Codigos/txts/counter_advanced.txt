    // Name: Counter (Advanced)
    // Description:Code for your very own advanced hit counter. Not only does it count hits, it also gets stat information on the user such as Browser and OS. Great for beginners learning basic PHP functions and PHP Environment variables. Commented well. Spaced for easier reading. Compatible with PHP 3.x and 4.x and works on all OS's.
    // By: Bann
    //
    //
    // Inputs:None.
    //
    // Returns:Returns the number of hits to your page and a file with information on the users visiting your page.
    //
    //Assumes:Copy and paste the code below into a file named count.php. The dir your counter file (NOT count.php, the file that will save the count) is in needs to be chmoded 777. Just use the include command (include("count.php");) and then call it (echo Count();). To see the userstats, goto the dir with the counter file (NOT count.php) and look at stats.txt with your favorite text editor.
