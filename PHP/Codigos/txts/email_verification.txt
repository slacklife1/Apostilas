    //**************************************
    // Name: Email Verification
    // Description:This is a function that validates email address using regex. Will also check for top level domain names (.com, .net, .edu).
    // By: Burhan Khalid
    //
    //
    // Inputs:One value, of type string, which is the email address that you want to check.
    //
    // Returns:True or False based on the result of the check. Returns true if the email address verifies.
    //
    //Assumes:This code is not fool proof. You might want to trim() your email address before you send it to the function. I designed this to use in concert with my "send me an email" page.
    //
    //Side Effects:Does not check for country specific domains, (ie. .co.uk), although with enough feedback, I might implement that in a future version.
