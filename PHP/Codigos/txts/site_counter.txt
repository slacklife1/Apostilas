    		/*
    		This is a cool site counter that will count the hits on each individual page on your site.
    		You need to have mysql installed on your webserver and you also need to make a table that
    		has atleast the three fields:
    		
    		id (int)
    		page (text)
    		hits (int)
    		
    		You can easily edit this code to include such tracking elements as date and time and IPs with just a few more lines 
    		of code and more tables but I will leave that to you.
    		*?
    		
    		
    		//variable declarations
    		$DB_LOGIN = "MySQL USER NAME";
    		$DB_PASSWORD = "MySQL PASSWORD";

    		$table_name = "YOUR TABLE NAME GOES HERE";
    		$current_page = $PHP_SELF;
    		
    		/*
    		This if statement connects you to the mysql database. Ideally you should put this in a different include file, 
    		but this is good if you do not know much about mysql and php.
