    if you expand on the code would want a copy of it.
    //**************************************
    // Name: previous next(working)updated already
    // Description:i set this code up to keep from having to rewrite sql code.
    as well as a having previous next on my search results. this code
    could be expanded on for many other things.
    this should cut your code way down. on repeating mysql statements.
    this is just my version for previous next.
    i have not found any bugs in it as of yet except now and then there
    may be a blank page at the end of results.
    of your max results is only 1 then the last page will be blank.
    i have only tested to 25 and else it seems to work fine.
    let me know of any bugs you see in it and find other than what i stated.
    i have fixed the blank page at the end on some listing by using $pages=ceil($num_result1/$max);
    rather than using number_format();this should be exceptional now.
