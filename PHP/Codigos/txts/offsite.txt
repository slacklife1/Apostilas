    // Name: Offsite File Inclusion
    // Description:If you have your site split across several servers, but you don't want tacky navigation, this script will help you.
    // By: Joshua D. Hyrman
    //
    //
    // Inputs:off_site - the offsite to get the file from
    data_start - the data start tag of your file
    data_end - the data end tag of your file
    page - the page to get from the offsite
    //
    // Returns:All data from page between all pairs of data_start and data_end
    //
    //Assumes:Assumes your server supports PHP and fopen for remote files. The offsite server MUST support HTTP/1.0 requests. I'll be changing this.
    //
    //Side Effects:Will not work with offsite servers that don't support HTTP/1.0 requests. So far I have tried and failed with: 50megs, 00homepage (topcities), and Angelfire.
