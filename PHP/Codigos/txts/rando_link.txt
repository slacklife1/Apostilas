    // Name: Random Link
    // Description:This code will select a particular random line from a file you specify and display it on a page. The line can contain HTML code, text, etc. I chose to use this as a random link script, but it could be used as a quote script or whatever you'd like.
    Just make sure that you only use carriage returns between the lines. You may come up with a blank line every great once in awhile, this is due to the assumed carriage return at EOF. Don't ask me. :)
