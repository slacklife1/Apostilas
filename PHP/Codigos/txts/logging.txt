    // Name: Logging IP's
    // Description:This is basically an IP-logger, which keeps a record of if a person with that ip has been there before.
    This is great for counters which will prevent refresh-increasing the count. Just place the counter-events witin the correct function. The Welcome-part and not the Welcome back.
    // By: Klaus Andersen
    //
    //
    // Inputs:None
    //
    // Returns:The main function returns true and false, depending on if the curren ip of the browser is in the file.
    //
    //Assumes:Basic php knowledge. But clip and paste will work just as good.
    //
    //Side Effects:There might be bugs, I havent tested it enough, if there is a flaw please post a reply.
