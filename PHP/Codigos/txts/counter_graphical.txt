    // Name: Counter (Graphical)
    // Description:Code for your very own graphical hit counter. Instead of a text counter, this is one that looks much better yet still easy to understand! Can use your own numbers. Great for beginners learning basic PHP functions. Commented well. Spaced for easier reading. Compatible with PHP 3.x and 4.x and works on all OS's.
    // By: Bann
    //
    //
    // Inputs:None.
    //
    // Returns:Returns the number of hits to your page in a graphical format.
    //
    //Assumes:Copy and paste the code below into a file named count.php. The dir your counter file (NOT count.php, the file that will save the count) is in needs to be chmoded 777. Just use the include command (include("count.php");) and then call it (echo Count();). If you have your own graphics, just specify the dir to them at the top ($imagedir).
    //
    //Side Effects:None.
    //This code is copyrighted and has limited warranties.
    //Please see http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.235/lngWId.8/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm
    //for details.
