In this script i will show you how to show the number of rows in a field i will try to explain it so you can understand:
    And here is the script:
    <?php
    mysql_connect ("localhost", "Username", "Password") or die("cannot connect to the database");
    mysql_select_db ("Database name");
    $result = "SELECT <b>Field Goes Here<b> FROM Table Goes Here";
    $Result = mysql_query($result);
    $totalrows = mysql_num_rows($Result);
    echo "there are $totalrows rows";
    ?>
    O.k first you start the script with <?php then you have to connect to the datadase and select a database this is how you do it:
    <?php
    mysql_connect ("localhost", "Username", "Password") or die("cannot connect to the database");
    mysql_select_db ("Database name");
    then you select the fiels and table like this:
    $result = "SELECT <b>Field Goes Here<b> FROM Table Goes Here";
    then get the result and show it: 
    $Result = mysql_query($result);
    $totalrows = mysql_num_rows($Result);
    echo "there are $totalrows rows";
    and end the script with a ?>
