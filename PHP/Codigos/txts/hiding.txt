    // Name: Hiding the name of your web files using SSI
    // Description:This code will hide the true name of your files.
    // By: Jeremy Sinclair
    //
    //
    // Inputs:None
    //
    // Returns:It returns the page or file u typed in but keeps the url for example if you wanted to view profile.html your url would be http://blah.com/main.php?pg=profile&type=HTML Page and when its viewed it will keep that url and wont change to http://blah.com/profile.html
    //
    //Assumes:You can add different files extensions in here or delete different extensions or even change the name of the variables. for example if your code said INCLUDE "$pg.$type"; down at the botton of the php source code.. then your url would be http://blah.com/main.php?pg=stuff&type=HTML files. u could change it to INCLUDE "$id.$stuff"; or just have INCLUDE "$pg.html"; and you could take the other include out and only have it view the html files in your directory. and u can change whatever u want in there.
    //
    //Side Effects:If you choose to use the GIF,JPG or JPEG Images the image files must be uploaded in binary format or you will get a ascii parse error
