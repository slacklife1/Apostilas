    // Name: ^ A Registration Password Trick
    // Description:Ever wonder how when you registered online somewhere, on the next page where your username and password are confirmed, only the first few chars of the p-word are shown and the rest of it are asterisks to keep from prying eyes. <b>Please Rate</b>
    // By: Darryl Porter
    //
    //
    // Inputs:This script processes the username/password registered by the end user.
    //
    // Returns:None
    //
    //Assumes:uses two functions--strlen() and substr()--and a "while loop." the strlen() function returns the length of anything that can be stored in a variable. The second, substr(), takes a part of anything that is stored in a variable. Example: $foo = Hello World;
    $foofoo = substr($foo, 0, 7);
    $foofoo == Hello Wor

    $length = strlen($password); //Gets the length of the Password
    $sub_password = substr($password, 0, 4); 
    //(Comment for the code above)This takes the original passwords and cuts it length.
    //First, I plug-in the original variable. Then, the number at the beginning of the string. 
    //The second number controls how much of the password will be revealed.
    //Remember that PHP starts counting at 0. 
    	
    		
    $length2 = strlen($sub_password); 
    //This gets the length of the password after is has been cut

    //(Comment for the code above)This is a simple While Loop--While the length of the original
    //password is greater than the length of the cut password
    //there will be "*" printed out. This is to reveal the 
    //first few characters of the password after registration, and the last few
    //are replaced for security.
